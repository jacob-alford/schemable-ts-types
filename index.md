## Disclaimer

This library is in its nascent stages (< 1.0.0) and still has a lot of work ahead before it's at feature parity with `io-ts-types`, or `validators.js`.

Currently supported:

- `date` > `SafeDate.ts`
- `number` > `Int.ts`
- `number` > `Natural.ts`
- `number` > `NegativeInt.ts`
- `number` > `PositiveInt.ts`
- `string` > `EmailAddress.ts`
- `string` > `IntString.ts`
- `string` > `ISODateString.ts`
- `string` > `NaturalString.ts`
- `string` > `NegativeIntString.ts`
- `string` > `NonemptyString.ts`
- `string` > `PositiveIntString.ts`
- `string` > `UUID.ts`

## Contributing

This library current has 100% jest coverage, contributions are highly encouraged and we should seek to maintain this high level of test coverage. Send over a PR!

## Schemable types explained

### The problem:

At present there is no way\* in vanilla Typescript to derive domain typeclasses from domain types. Languages like Haskell, Purescript, and Rust support this functionality out of the box. With the older `io-ts` system you would have a domain declaration that looks like the following.

\*([ts-plus](https://dev.to/matechs/the-case-for-ts-18b3) seeks to extend Typescript with this functionality and more)

```typescript
import * as t from 'io-ts'

export const User = t.type({
  name: t.string,
  email: t.string,
  age: t.number,
})

export type User = t.TypeOf<typeof User>
```

Elsewhere in your package you could consume the `User` type using `User.decode(/* Some unknown data structure */)`, which would guarantee that the runtime type (if value was a `Right` value) conforms to the expected data structure.

The more recent development in `io-ts` splits `t` – a collection of combinators which construct a class of Decoders/Encoders – into distinct modules, `Decoder`, `Encoder`, `Eq`, etc. Using this newer system presents a challenge, as you can no longer get `Decoder`, `Encoder` in a unified class with a single definition.

```typescript
import * as D from 'io-ts/Decoder'
import * as Eq from 'io-ts/Eq'
import * as G from 'io-ts/Guard'

export type User = {
  name: string
  email: string
  age: number
  id: string
}

export const decodeUser: D.Decoder<User> = D.struct({
  name: D.string,
  email: D.string,
  age: D.number,
  id: D.string,
})

export const eqUser: Eq.Eq<User> = Eq.struct({
  name: Eq.string,
  email: Eq.string,
  age: Eq.number,
  id: Eq.string,
})

export const guardUser: G.Guard<User> = G.struct({
  name: G.string,
  email: G.string,
  age: G.number,
  id: G.string,
})
```

This works well and is type safe. But it comes with a big downside: if we need to change something, it is necessary to change it in four different places.

### The solution: Schema / Schemable

With Schemable, you first provide instructions (`Schema`) to construct a domain type, and then provide a way to interpret instructions (`Schemable`).

The example above can be refined to the following with Schema and Schemable:

```typescript
import { interpreter, make, TypeOf } from 'io-ts/Schema'
import * as D from 'io-ts/Decoder'
import * as Eq from 'io-ts/Eq'
import * as G from 'io-ts/Guard'

const UserSchema = make(S =>
  S.struct({
    name: S.string,
    email: S.string,
    age: S.number,
    id: S.string,
  })
)

export type User = TypeOf<UserSchema>

export const decodeUser = interpreter(D.Schemable)(UserSchema)

export const eqUser = interpreter(Eq.Schemable)(UserSchema)

export const guardUser = interpreter(G.Schemable)(UserSchema)
```

And with this, the structure of domain types and operators come from a single source, making future maintanence and extension trivial.

### The value of an extended Schemable

With an extended schemable typeclass you have the powerful features of `io-ts-types` (restricted to the older `Type` system) and `validators.js` (written in javascript, and more difficult to adopt in a purely functional environment) with a modern domain type declaration system, and the power of fp-ts.

Let's refine our User type.

```typescript
import { D, Eq, G, SC } from 'schemable-ts-types'

const UserSchema = SC.make(S =>
  S.struct({
    name: S.NonemptyString,
    email: S.Email,
    age: S.Natural,
    id: S.UUID({ version: 5 }),
  })
)

export type User = SC.TypeOf<UserSchema>

export const decodeUser = SC.interpreter(D.Schemable)(UserSchema)

export const eqUser = SC.interpreter(Eq.Schemable)(UserSchema)

export const guardUser = SC.interpreter(G.Schemable)(UserSchema)
```

And now we can guarantee that a user's email will conform to RFC 5322, their id will be a proper UUID-v5, and their age will not be negative.
